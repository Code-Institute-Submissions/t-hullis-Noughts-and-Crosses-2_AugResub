aim : create game of noughts and crosses using mostly javascript, which tell user who is 
winner and gives option to restart game and keep score. Building the board as an object in 
javascript, should allow me to give it all the features needed.

1 : set board div, players and an array to house the board squares position tracker. 

2 : create an object with properties of index, tile.

3 : Create a for loop to create tile of the board with an index.

4 : create functions for game over, draw and winnner.
